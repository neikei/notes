## 2017-07-15: Fix locale warnings on Linux servers

**Problem:** Warnings about wrong or missing locale configurations

```bash
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC_ALL = (unset),
LC_PAPER = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_ADDRESS = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_MONETARY = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_NUMERIC = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_TELEPHONE = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_IDENTIFICATION = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_MEASUREMENT = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_CTYPE = "en_US.UTF-8",
LC_TIME = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LC_NAME = "de_DE.UTF-8",
LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to a fallback locale ("en_US.UTF-8").
```

**Solution 1: dpkg-reconfigure** Reconfiguration of the locales with dpkg

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

**Solution 2: /etc/default/locale**

```bash
sudo su -
echo LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" >> /etc/default/locale
```
