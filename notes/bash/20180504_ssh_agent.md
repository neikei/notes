### 2018-05-05: SSH-Agent

As admin or developer you should use SSH keys for the login on your server.

**Create a SSH Key** on your jumpserver and set a passphrase

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yourname@mail.tld"
```

**Add the public key to your destination servers** to enable login via your new created SSH key

```bash
#: Check your public key on the jumpserver
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

#: Add the public key to your destination servers authorized_keys
echo "<your_public_key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

#: Sometimes you have to check the file permissions on your destination server
chmod 700 /root/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**SSH-Agent autostart** during login on your jumpserver

Add the following snippet to your ~/.bash_profile on your jumpserver...

```bash
echo "==> SSH agent startup"
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] ; then
  eval `ssh-agent -s`
  ssh-add
fi
echo "==> SSH agent startup"
```

... and add the following snippet to your ~/.bash_logout to close the ssh-agent properly

```bash
if [ -n "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] ; then
  eval `/usr/bin/ssh-agent -k`
fi
```
